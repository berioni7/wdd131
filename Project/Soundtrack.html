       <h1 class="welcome">Composers</h1>
       <p class="w1"><strong>Composers</strong> create soundtracks that help tell the story of a movie through music. Their compositions intensify emotions, create atmospheres and reinforce the identity of scenes and characters. They work closely with directors to understand the tone and rhythm of the narrative. Music can completely transform the viewer's experience, even when subtle. In cinema, sound is as powerful as image.</p>      
       <h2 class="gp">Main responsibilities of a composer:</h2>
       
       <ul>
        <li class="ps1">Create original soundtracks that express the film's emotions, themes and atmospheres.</li>
        <li class="ps2">Work in collaboration with the director and production team, understanding the artistic vision of the work.</li>
        <li class="ps3">Synchronize the music with the scenes, respecting tempo, rhythm and changes in tone.</li>
        <li class="ps4">Choosing or guiding the ideal orchestration and instruments for each moment of the score.</li>
        <li class="ps5">Adjusting and revising compositions based on feedback, refining until the desired effect is achieved.</li>
